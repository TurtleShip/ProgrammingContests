A key fact to keep in mind is that
you want to minimize the number of miss.
One way to achieve this effect is to make the configuration
of each jar the same as much as possible so that you
can assume that each jar is identical as much as possible.

For example, let's look at case #3.
There are 3 jars, 4 coins, and we want to get all 4 coins.
The optimal strategy is to put 2 coins each to 2 jars.
Then we have two jars with 2 coins, and 1 jar with no coins.
Then we only need to miss once when we pick the jar with
no coins.

Notice that there is another configuration that haves
2 jar with 1 coin and 1 jar with 2 coins.
However in this case, you need to miss
