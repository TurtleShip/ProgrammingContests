Basic algorithm

Say that we have all possible pairs of coprime pairs.

vector< vector<int> >cop[N];

cop[i] = vector< vector<int> >
	   = list of all possible coprime pairs of size i

res = 0
part0 = 0
part1 = 0
Given N grandchidren, 
1) Add the minimum number to each Ai so that each Ai is a multiple of K.
  part0 += all the minimum numbers.
2) Divide each Ai by K.
3) Now we have a new version of Ai's.
4) Compare the list of A with all lists in cop[N]
   For each cop[N][i],
   	if all Aj can become cop[N][i][j] by adding values to Aj,
   		part1 = min(part1, all the added values)


res = part0 + K*part1
